Abstract: The system of equations and figures presented in Imtiaz et al. (2002) are verified and reproduced in the current curation paper. Here, to demonstrate reproducibility, We describe the model encoded in the CellML and document the differences between our curated model and the one published by Imtiaz et al.. From the primary publication, we extracted data applying the Engauge digitizer software (Mitchell et al., 2020) to compare the current CellML simulation results against those in the primary publication. Editor's note: revised to remove  LaTeX code from the abstract.

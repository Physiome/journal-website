Abstract: Many researchers in the last couple of decades have suggested that glucose absorption in the small intestine depends on both constitutively expressed SGLT1 and translocated GLUT2 in the brush border membrane, especially in the presence of a high concentration of luminal glucose. Afshar et al. generated a computational model of non-isotonic glucose uptake by small intestinal epithelial cells. The model incorporates apical uptake via SGLT1 and GLUT2, basolateral efflux into the blood via GLUT2 and cellular volume changes in response to non-isotonic conditions. The dependence of glucose absorption on luminal glucose, blood flow rate, and inlet blood glucose concentration is studied, and the results explain more about the role of apical GLUT2 in intestinal cell glucose absorption. Here, we used the CellML file provided by the model authors, together with SED-ML files and Python scripts, to demonstrate the reproduction of the figures in the original paper by using the associated model.

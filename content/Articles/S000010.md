Abstract: The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the natural pacemaker of the mammalian heart. It has been the subject of several mathematical studies, aimed at reproducing its electrical response under normal sinus rhythms, as well as under various conditions. Such studies were traditionally done using data from rabbit SAN cells. More recently, human SAN cell data have become available, resulting in the publication of a human SAN cell model (Fabbri et al., 2017), along with its CellML version. Here, we used the CellML file provided by the model authors, together with some SED-ML files and Python scripts that we created to reproduce the main results of the aforementioned modeling study. EDITOR'S NOTE (v2): this article and its OMEX archive are republished with technical changes made to the corresponding Python scripts to remove a run-time error message displayed when executing each simulation.

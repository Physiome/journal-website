Abstract: The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the natural pacemaker of the mammalian heart. It has been the
the subject of several mathematical studies, aimed at reproducing its electrical response under normal
sinus rhythms, as well as under various conditions.
Such studies were traditionally done using data from rabbit SAN cells. More recently, human SAN
cell data have become available, resulting in the publication of a human SAN cell model (Fabbri
et al., 2017), along with its CellML version.
Here, we used the CellML file provided by the model authors, together with some SED-ML files
and Python scripts that we created to reproduce the main results of the aforementioned modeling
study.

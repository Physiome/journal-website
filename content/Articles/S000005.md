Abstract: We describe a major development of the Shorten et al. (Shorten et al., 2007) model of skeletal
muscle electrophysiology, biochemistry, and mechanics. The model was developed by incorporating
equations for sarcolemmal transport of calcium ions, including L-type calcium channel,
sodium-calcium exchange, calcium pump, and background calcium channel. The extended model
also includes an addition to the equations for extracellular potassium ion movements to enable
the exchange of potassium ions between bulk (plasma) concentration and the interstitial and
tubular compartments to be modeled. In further research in an accompanying paper (Tasaki et
al, 2019), we succeeded in reproducing muscle cramp, as well as its prevention and reversal, by
investigating muscle contraction and cramp using this extended model in comparison with the
original model.

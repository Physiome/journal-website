Abstract: In the present paper, we re-formulate the models from Boron and De Weer (1976), henceforth referred to as ‘BDW’, and specify the simulation using the Physiome modelling standards CellML (www.cellml.org) and SED-ML (www.sed-ml.org) in order to ensure that the model reproduces the graphs in the original paper. Note that this effort requires the specification of some parameters used in BDW’s simulations, but not described in the BDW paper. The curated and annotated model is made available in a form that users can run with OpenCOR (www.opencor.ws) to understand the model and to explore the effect of changes in parameter values.

Abstract: The mechanistic model of neurovascular coupling was developed and studied by Sten et al. (2020). This model describes and predicts the arteriolar dilation data of mice under various stimulations while anaesthetised and awake. We reconstructed the model in CellML, using a modular approach for each neuronal pathway, and successfully reproduced the original experiments (see the figures in this article and Sten et al. (2020)). With the success of the result reproduction, the CellML model can now be injected into other OpenCOR workflows to obtain a mechanistic hemodynamic response function of neurovascular coupling arteriolar dilation.

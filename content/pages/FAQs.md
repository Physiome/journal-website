### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a primary publication and a *Physiome* publication?**

**My code is already in my primary publication. Why do I need a *Physiome* publication?**

**Does the primary publication need to be published before submitting the corresponding *Physiome* publication?**

**In my submission, do I have to include code for every figure in the primary publication?**

**My code is in a specific deprecated language - must I translate it?**

Code language does not have to be a standard markup language - as long as we can run it our computers. Provide instructions on the run.

**What is OMEX?**

An <a style="color:#580078" href="http://co.mbine.org/standards/omex">OMEX archive</a> is a ZIP container containing all files required for implementation of the model. It can be opened by any type of ZIP reader - just replace ".omex" with ".zip".

**I can't find my *Physiome* publication on pubmed/worldcat?**

Each article has a DOI unique to it - it is not the same as the primary publication's. You will see your *Physiome* publication on international databases soon.

**What is the impact factor for *Physiome*?**

**Where are the physical *Physiome* issues?**

We are currently an online-only journal, publishing as soon as submissions are curated.

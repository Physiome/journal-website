### Frequently Asked Questions
***
<h5 id="difference"><em>What is the difference between a primary publication and a <i>Physiome</i> publication?</em></h5>

This is an experimental or modelling paper describing the model, and has been accepted to a peer-reviewed journal in the field of physiological modelling. The primary publication shows that the model is validated by describing the experiments and data, and how the model fits to the data. In addition, it should include relevant biological background, and explain why the model is important. 

*Physiome* articles focus on reproducibility and reuse, but do not deal with the validation nor scientific relevance of the models: this is reviewed in the Primary Paper.
***

<h5 id="why"><em>My code is already in my primary publication. Why do I need a <i>Physiome</i> publication?</em></h5>

Any modifications made to the primary paper can be finalised in order to meet reproducibility and reusability standards. 
***

<h5 id="publish_before"><em>Does the primary publication need to be published before submitting the corresponding <i>Physiome</i> publication?</em></h5>
No: for original submissions, authors are encouraged to prepare their Physiome submission(s) in parallel to the Primary Publication. Submissions will be curated and evaluated, but not published until the Primary Publication is accepted. 
***

<h5 id="every_figure"><em>In my submission, do I have to include code for every figure in the primary publication?</em></h5>
No.
***

<h5 id="language"><em>My code is in a specific deprecated language - must I translate it?</em></h5>

Code language does not have to be a standard markup language - as long as we can run it our computers. Provide exact instructions on how to execute the files included in your submission.
***

<h5 id="standard_format"><em>What is a standard format?</em></h5>
A markup languages such as CellML, SBML, NeuroML and FieldML, designed to encode a model in unambiguous form. The markup language SED-ML is designed to specify the simulation protocol for running the model with specified inputs and outputs.
***

<h5 id="omex"><em>What is OMEX?</em></h5>

An <a style=href="http://co.mbine.org/standards/omex">OMEX archive</a> is a ZIP container containing all files required for implementation of the model. It can be opened by any type of ZIP reader - just replace ".omex" with ".zip".
***

<h5 id="pubmed"><em>I can't find my <i>Physiome</i> publication on pubmed/worldcat?</em></h5>

Each article has a DOI unique to it - it is not the same as the primary publication's. You will see your <i>Physiome</i> publication on international databases soon.
***

<h5 id="impact_factor"><em>What is the impact factor for <i>Physiome</i>?</em></h5>
We are a new journal! We are working on appearing on various international databases.
***

<h5 id="physical"><em>Where are the physical <i>Physiome</i> issues?</em></h5>
We are an online only journal, publishing as soon as submissions are curated. Given the nature of the submissions, which are heavy on computer code, there are no physical copies of the journal.

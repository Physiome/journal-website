Instructions to Authors
-----------------------
All submissions to *Physiome* must be associated with one, or more, articles accepted by peer-reviewed physiology, bioengineering or biophysics journals. Authors are encouraged to prepare their Physiome submission(s) in parallel to the primary paper. Submissions will not be curated and evaluated until the primary paper is accepted, but authors will be able to access and share their submission via the [Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org).

### Types of submissions
The following types of submissions will be considered for publication in *Physiome*.

* **Original submission**

	Original submissions are author initiated submissions directly associated with a primary experimental or modelling paper that has been accepted by a peer-reviewed physiology, bioengineering, or biophysics journal. While matching authorship between the Physiome submission and the primary article is not a requirement, it is expected that there is at least some overlap for original submissions.

* **Retrospectives**

	A retrospective is similar in most regards to an original submission, but is associated with an historical primary article which has been deemed to provide substantial value to the physiological modelling community in making a reusable, reproducible, and discoverable version of the study available. Where possible, the authors of retrospective submissions should include authors from the primary article. Retrospectives may be invited by the *Physiome* editors or can be author initiated. When submitting a retrospective, it is best to first submit an expression of interest to the editors outlining why the original primary paper should be considered a suitable contribution to *Physiome*.

* **Reviews**

	The *Physiome* editorial board may solicit review submissions that document a range of published models in a given area. Such reviews will make use of previously accepted *Physiome* submissions, often applying new data or simulation experiments to explore the capabilities of the various models.

* **Letters**

	A letter is an original submission that provides new insights about, or refinement of, a model that is already published on the Physiome site. This format allows publication of material that in itself may not justify a separate submission to a primary peer-reviewed journal, but which may still be highly instrumental for improving an existing model, expand its empirical scope or invoke experimental and theoretical research that may drive new model development. Examples of such material include, but are not restricted to, experimental measurements of important parameter values that have been only indirectly estimated in the original paper, empirically or theoretically justified questioning or refutation of critical model premises, experimental data confirming or refuting model predictions, and theoretical analyses of the model that provide novel insights that may spur further model development or experimental work.
	

### Preparing your submission
Submissions should be prepared using the Overleaf template or MS Word template. Please contact *Physiome* if you have any queries. These templates will provide the main document for the submission, but the submission must include all resources required to evaluate the reproducibility, reusability, and discoverability of the submission. As described in the templates, such resources can be directly included in the Overleaf project or zip archive, or linked to via appropriate online repositories or databases.

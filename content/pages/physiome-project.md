The Physiome Project
--------------------
The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) launched the [Physiome Project](http://www.physiomeproject.org)) at the IUPS World Congress in St Petersburg in 1997 in order to bring quantitative bioengineering approaches to the study of anatomy and physiology. In particular this approach advocates the use of anatomically and biophysically based mathematical models that deal with physiological processes operating over multiple spatial and temporal scales. The major focus of the project has been the creation of standards, tools and databases for reproducible and reusable mathematical models of physiological processes. 
The journal *Physiome* is an initiative taken by the Physiome Project to incentivise and reward publication and reuse of standardised models, by ensuring that the code is reproducible and  published open access. It is the role of the companion primary journal to ensure that the model has been validated.
